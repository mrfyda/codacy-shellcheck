# Codacy ShellCheck

Create the docker: `sbt docker:publishLocal`

The docker is supposed to be run with the following command:

```sh
docker run -it - $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
```

and $srcDir must contain a valid `.codacy.json` configuration

## Test

Follow the instructions at [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test/blob/master/README.md#test-definition)

## Generating the documentation

Update the `VERSION` variable and run:

```bash
cd docs
./generate.sh
```

This will create updated `patterns.json`, `description.json` and the individual documentation Markdown files.
