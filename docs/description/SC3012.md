## In POSIX sh, lexicographical `\<` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
x="aardvark"
y="zebra"
if [ $x \< $y ]
then
  echo "$x comes before $y in the dictionary"
fi
```

### Correct code:

First, make sure you wanted a lexicographical comparison (aka dictionary order), and not a numerical comparison.

Then to compare as string, you can use `expr` and make sure that the strings are not interpreted numerically by adding some non-numerical data to them. Here, an apostrophe is prepended:

```
#!/bin/sh
x="aardvark"
y="zebra"
if expr "'$x" \< "'$y"   > /dev/null 
then
  echo "$x comes before $y in the dictionary"
fi
```

### Rationale:

The `test` binary operators `>`, `\>`, `<`, and `\<` are not part of POSIX and not guaranteed to be supported in scripts targeting `sh`.

The `expr` functionality is specified by POSIX.

### Exceptions:

If you know your `sh` will be e.g. `dash`, consider explicitly using `#!/bin/dash`.
