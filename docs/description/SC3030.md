## In POSIX sh, arrays are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
x=( foo bar "Hello World" )
for word in "${x[@]}"
do
  touch "$word.dat"
done
```

### Correct code:

Consider switching to a shell that does support arrays, such as `bash` or `ksh`, by changing the shebang.

Alternatively, if you only need a single array at a time, you may be able to rewrite to use the positional parameters:

```sh
set -- foo bar "Hello World"
for word in "$@"
do
  touch "$word.dat"
done
```

or strings with carefully chosen delimiters:

```sh
x='foo
bar
Hello World
'

printf '%s' "$x" |
  while IFS='' read -r word
  do
    touch "$word.dat"
  done
```

### Rationale:

Arrays are specific to Bash and Ksh, but you are using them in a script declared to run with `sh` or `dash`. These shells do not support arrays at all. You should either switch to Bash/Ksh, or rewrite the script to not use arrays.

There are no great replacements, especially not that can be mechanically applied, but using the positional parameters or a delimited string works in many cases, as shown in the examples. 

### Exceptions:

None.
